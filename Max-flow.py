'''Movie distribution - max flow algorithm

Suppose a movie distributor would like to ship a copy of a film from CA to every other state. 
There are therefore 48 units to ship out of CA, and each other state receives 1 unit.
The dataset contiguous-usa.dat lists the adjacent states in the US. Each line lists two adjacent states; 
thus AK and HI are omitted, but DC is included in the data.'''


import networkx as nx
G = nx.Graph()

# reading in the graph of US states
usa = open('contiguous-usa.dat.txt')
for line in usa:
    s1, s2 = line.strip().split()
    G.add_edge(s1, s2)

 # encode demands into graph G
for state in G.nodes():
	if state != 'CA':
		G.node[state]['demand'] = 1
G.node['CA']['demand'] = -48


'''
First assign a uniform capacity of 16 to each edge. 
Since CA has only three adjacent states, this is the smallest possible uniform capacity that allows one to ship all 48 units out of CA. 
As we have created an undirected graph, and flows have directions, we first convert the graph to a directed graph.
